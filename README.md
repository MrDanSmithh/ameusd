## Project Vision
The project is to develop a status dashboard for customers of AME Solutions who have expressed an interest in purchasing or have already purchased AMEâ€™s Ubiquiti UniFi wireless solution.  

An existing customer has purchased a complete upgrade and have installed a Ubiquiti UniFi wireless network, supplied and configured by AME Solutions. 
The customer has a team of caretakers who have installed all the access points and will be their job to maintain and ensure that the access points are online and if necessary, reboot them or check the status of them.  

The manager of the venue requires to view data usage to determine if the internet connection installed is sufficient to provide a good service, alongside identifying busy areas of the venue to help improve marketing.

The product is not designed to replace the UniFi controller, but to work alongside it to provide an effective and easy-to-read marketing tool.
